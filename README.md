CSV Manipulation
Create a new Java project.
Create a Program class with a main function that performs the following actions:
Parse the file: “C:\Automation\CsvFiles\CsvInput.csv”
The file contains three columns: A, B, C.
Add three new columns called “Expression Result”, “Is Palindrome” and “Reversed String”.
For each row in the file:
Calculate the following expression (A+B)*(A*B) and write in the new column “Expression Result”.
Check if the string in column C is a Palindrome, And enter True/False in column “Is Palindrome”.
Reverse the string in column C and write the result in column “Reversed String”.

Create a new file: “C:\Automation\CsvFiles\CsvOutput.csv” and write the old and new columns to it in the original order.
